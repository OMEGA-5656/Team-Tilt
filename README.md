A 2D platformer game using Java and LibGDX, featuring physics-based movement and touch controls for Android devices. Integrated Box2D for realistic player-platform interactions and Scene2D for responsive UI, including on-screen buttons and a custom main menu. Explored multiplayer functionality by prototyping an online mode, gaining insights into networked gameplay challenges. Managed assets and rendering with SpriteBatch and used Git for version control. This project strengthened my expertise in game development, physics simulation, and user interface design.
